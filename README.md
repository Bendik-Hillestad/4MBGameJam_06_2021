# 4MB Game Jam 06/2021

This is the source code for my entry to the [4MB Game Jam 06/2021](https://itch.io/jam/4mb): [The Climb](https://grim69420.itch.io/tower-climb) (title is WIP).
The source code has been somewhat cleaned up, but no features, bugfixes or optimizations have been added.

NOTE: The source code has not yet been uploaded. I am currently working on the repository.

## Instructions

You have three options for getting the executable:
1. You can download the executable that was uploaded on itch.io here: [link](https://grim69420.itch.io/tower-climb#download)
2. Download the executable built from the source here by GitHub Actions: [link](https://github.com/Bendik-Hillestad/4MBGameJam_06_2021/releases/latest)
3. Build from source yourself.

   To build from source, you must clone the repository, launch a "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2019", navigate in the commandline to the folder containing the source and run build.bat.
   You will find the resulting executable in the out folder.
