# 4MB Game Jam 06/2021

This is the source code for my entry to the [4MB Game Jam 06/2021](https://itch.io/jam/4mb), called [The Climb](https://grim69420.itch.io/tower-climb) (title is WIP).
The source code has been somewhat cleaned up, but no features, bugfixes or optimizations have been added.

## Instructions

You have three options for getting the executable:
1. You can download the executable that was uploaded on itch.io here: [link](https://grim69420.itch.io/tower-climb#download).
2. Download the executable built from the source here by GitHub Actions: [link](https://github.com/Bendik-Hillestad/4MBGameJam_06_2021/releases/latest).
3. Build from source yourself.

   To build from source, you must first clone the repository. Then you can either open the project file in Visual Studio 2019 and build from there, or preferably launch a "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2019", navigate in the commandline to the folder containing the source and run build.bat. You will find the resulting executable in the out folder.
